Convert maps from Quaver to Intralism format

## Usage

Just run the main file with python. You'll need to adjust STEAMPATH, and select the songs you want to convert programmatically.

You might want to disable Steam Cloud sync, since the generated maps will clutter your Editor folder and will be uploaded to the cloud.
